# 🔌 EV Charging Demand Forecasting

This project forecasts Electric Vehicle (EV) charging demand using machine learning models trained on real-world data. It is developed as part of a virtual internship program.

---

## 📅 Week 1: EV Adoption Forecasting

- Collected and analyzed real-world EV registration data
- Preprocessed raw data (`Electric_Vehicle_Population_By_County.csv`)
- Built and evaluated a regression model
- Exported results and created GitHub Pages site

---

## 📅 Week 2: Advanced Forecasting with Cleaned Data

- Used cleaned dataset: `preprocessed_ev_data.csv`
- Trained a Random Forest model
- Evaluated performance (R², MAE, MSE)
- Saved the trained model: `forecasting_ev_model.pkl`
- Updated project notebook: `ev_adoption_forecasting.ipynb`
- Updated web interface: `index.html`

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
